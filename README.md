# New living (Apple iOS)

The New Living app was created for the "Apple Device Programming" class and is part of the New Living system.
It's an open source system that allows users to easily and modularly create their own smart-house, 
where users can create their own modules and share them with other users. 
The entire system is being developed for an engineering thesis at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science
at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun.
